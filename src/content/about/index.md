# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm ReaJason

I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in topography from [Central South University of Forestry and Technology](https://www.csuft.edu.cn/) in 2021.

I first delved into programming in 2020 and initially chose to learn Python and developed a keen interest in web scraping. During my university years, I successfully created projects involving [WBTopicCheckTool](https://github.com/ReaJason/WBTopicCheckTool) and [17wanxiaoCheckin](https://github.com/ReaJason/17wanxiaoCheckin). Currently, I am actively working on [xhs](https://github.com/ReaJason/xhs) and [Clash-Butler](https://github.com/ReaJason/Clash-Butler).

In 2021, I ventured into Java programming, utilizing Spring Boot and Vue to build a self-hosted blog. Presently, I am engaged in work related to [**Runtime application self-protection(RASP)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_application_self-protection) and cyber security at [boundaryx](https://www.boundaryx.com/).

Iâ€™m interested in exploring how to productively use the Rust programming language in operating systems. Ultimately, I aspire to develop an open-source project implementing RASP at the JVM level using Rust.

I have a keen interest in computers. That is why I chose to work in the computer industry, and in the days to come, I hope I can become a computer master through continuous learning. **Develop tools that we ourselves are eager to utilize.** My career goal is to build software products that people want and find valuable.

The purpose of this blog site is to record and share my own learning and thinking. BTW, [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/) designed this blog style.
