Hi, I'm ReaJason. I'm a software developer. Nowadays, I work with Java and JavaScript.

B.S. in Surveying and Mapping, July 2021, Central South University of Forestry and Technology.

I have a keen interest in computers. That is why I chose to work in the computer industry, and in the days to come, I hope I can become a computer master through continuous learning.

The purpose of this blog site is to record and share my own learning and thinking. By thy way, [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/) designed this blog style. I want to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to rewrite it.
